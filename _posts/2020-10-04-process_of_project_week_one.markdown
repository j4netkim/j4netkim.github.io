Where do I begin.. 
I want to give some tips and advice about the project although I'm no professional at all. What I've really come to realize during this first project is that you need to make sure that you have a lot of EXTRA time just in case your project takes longer than expected. What I mean by that is you want to start is ASAP and give yourself maybe more than three days. You can definitely complete your CLI project in three to four days but if you really struggle with understanding what's happening on each line of your code, you'll want a lot of time to go through notes and google to study. 

My recommendations would be to attend office hours twice, each day that it is open for project help. What helped me the most though was having a classmate guide me through. When you have a fresh set of eyes and a completely different brain looking at what you wrote, chances are they'll see what you might've looked over. This was a very tough project for me and it tested my knowledge on the basics of what we learned previously. I found myself constantly googling the same terms sometimes because it wasn't drilled into my head yet. Also, I hope it's not just me but don't stress yourself if you're not understanding the explanations online. Sometimes it really helps looking at multiple links regarding the same for example, operator, you're looking at. I was extremely fortunate to have a knowledgable classmate reword concepts and break them down until it was clicking. 

Lastly, I can't stress enough at how important connecting with your classmates is. I was shy and really afraid to just ask someone a question. I know how tough it can be to teach someone. I'm a horrible explainer myself so for someone to sit down and explain to you how it clicked for them will help you. This was such a struggle but this is really where you are actually learning. What you're having issues with will all come out and at least you'll know what concepts are the ones blocking you from proceeding on to what you're trying to accomplish next. This entire project basically makes me want to go through all my lessons from day one and I really might just do that.
