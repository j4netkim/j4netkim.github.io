For what seemed like forever, I thought entering the world of programming was close to impossible. I've always held an interest in seeing code, hearing the terminology on shows, and the various projects one could come up with it. It's like immersing yourself in a completely different world. 

As someone who graduated with a business degree and was working a full-time office job, it made me question my future. It felt boring and lifeless. I wanted a change in my life. I've always been surrounded by people in my major or mutual friends in the general business department. The few people I knew of who actually studied programming were my male friends. It just didn't feel like something I could bring up and was shy about. The more time that went by, the more I realized I would always think back to "I wish I knew how to code. I wish I knew how to speak to a computer."  I had no idea where to start, what to look at, who to get help from, or maybe even what books to read. It felt like there was no entrance to the building and it was quite scary. I just really wanted to take a big leap of faith and go for something in my life that I really want and to be passionate about. To actually enjoy and learn something everyday. I'm both excited and nervous about this new journey in my life. There may be bumps along the way but I want to allow myself to grow and expand.
